# Ruby Playground
__**Where dreams really do come true!**__
The only purpose of this repository is to keep a record of the ideas I have investigated. Many of the concepts here are things have have learned before. Many of them I have learned multiple times... but they I am constantly forgetting the minutia of them. So, my intent is to have a code history which I can look back on that address the parts of Ruby which I find particularly sticky.
