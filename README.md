# Code Lab
__**Notes on Code Curiosities**__
The only purpose of this repository is to keep a record of the ideas I have investigated. Many of the concepts here are things have have learned before. Many of them I have learned multiple times... and many I will keep relearning for the rest of my life. So, the intent of this repository is to document new concepts or one that I otherwise find myself frequently looking up. By doing so, the hope is that I will need to look them up less frequently, or when I do, I will be able to quickly grasp them again using examples in my own words. Also to be found in this repository are cheat-sheet style reminders of the minutia of useful commands, functions, protocols, etc.
