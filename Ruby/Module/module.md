# Modules

### [Class Methods](./notes/ex_1.md)
#### Why would you put a class method on a module?
I feel like I have to relearn this kind of stuff whenever I try to think deeply about it. It's all about metaclasses and what the value of the `self` is. This was something I was trying to figure out when I was reading the [source code for the main module][bb] wrapping the byebug gem.
